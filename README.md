# variant-republisher

This plugins helps to re-publish libraries with natives (ie jogamp, lwjgl) to fix the metadata in oder to have proper support for the native libraries

The goal is to fix it for older versions and also future ones, in case the upstream project will never accept the PRs to fix their Gradle publication
